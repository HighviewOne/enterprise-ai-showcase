SMART GRID CONTROLLER - SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
Version 2.1 | Last Updated: 2025-03-15

1. INTRODUCTION
This document specifies the requirements for the Smart Grid Controller (SGC),
a system designed to monitor and manage electrical grid assets across substations.

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Real-Time Monitoring
The system shall collect telemetry data from all connected substations at intervals
no greater than 5 seconds. Data shall include voltage, current, frequency, and
power factor measurements.

2.2 Alarm Management
The system shall generate alarms when any measured parameter exceeds predefined
thresholds. Alarms shall be categorized as Critical, Warning, or Informational.
Critical alarms must be acknowledged within 60 seconds.

2.3 Load Balancing
The system shall automatically redistribute load across substations when any single
substation reaches 85% capacity. Load redistribution shall complete within 30 seconds.

2.4 Historical Data Storage
All telemetry data shall be stored for a minimum of 7 years to comply with
regulatory requirements (NERC CIP-010). Data older than 90 days may be moved to
archive storage.

2.5 User Interface
The system shall provide a web-based dashboard accessible from standard browsers
(Chrome, Firefox, Edge). The dashboard shall display real-time grid topology with
color-coded status indicators.

3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Performance
The system shall support up to 500 simultaneous substations without degradation.
Response time for any user action shall not exceed 2 seconds under normal load.

3.2 Availability
The system shall maintain 99.99% uptime (less than 52.6 minutes downtime per year).
Failover to backup systems shall complete within 15 seconds.

3.3 Security
All communications between the controller and substations shall use TLS 1.3 encryption.
User authentication shall support multi-factor authentication (MFA). All system access
shall be logged and auditable.

3.4 Scalability
The system shall be designed to scale to 2000 substations without architectural changes.
The system should support up to 500 substations without degradation.

4. INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS

4.1 SCADA Integration
The system shall integrate with existing SCADA systems using the IEC 61850 protocol.
Data exchange latency shall not exceed 100 milliseconds.

4.2 External APIs
The system shall provide RESTful APIs for third-party integration. API response time
shall not exceed 500 milliseconds for 95% of requests.

4.3 Legacy Support
The system shall support Modbus RTU protocol for legacy equipment. The system
shall require all communications to use IEC 61850 protocol exclusively.

5. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

5.1 Regulatory
The system shall comply with NERC CIP standards (CIP-002 through CIP-014).
Annual compliance reports shall be automatically generated.

5.2 Environmental
All hardware components shall operate within -40C to +60C temperature range.
The system shall meet EN 50121-4 electromagnetic compatibility standards.
